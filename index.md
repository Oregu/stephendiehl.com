**Hi, I'm Stephen Diehl.**

I'm a software engineer in Boston, Massachusetts.

I specialize in concurrency, parallelism, and event driven programming.

So we have some python code:

```pyexec
print 1+1
```

And it evaluates.

And we have a shell:

```pycon
>>> 1+1
```

And it evaluates

```python
for i in xrange(1000):
    print i
```

Some stuff.
